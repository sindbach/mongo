/**
 * During steady state replication, it is possible to find the local server in a state where it
 * cannot replicate from a sync source. This can happen if the local server has gone offline and
 * comes back to find a new primary with an inconsistent set of operations in its oplog from the
 * local server. For example:

 *     F = node that is on the wrong branch of history
 *     SS = sync source (usually primary)
 *
 *     F  : a b c d e f g
 *     SS : a b c d h
 *
 * In the example 'e', 'f', and 'g' are getting rolled back, 'h' is what's getting rolled forward.
 *
 * This class performs 'rollback' via the storage engine's 'recover to a stable timestamp'
 * machinery. This class runs synchronously on the caller's thread.
 *
 * Order of actions:
 *   1. Transition to ROLLBACK.
 *   2. Await background index completion.
 *   3. Find the common point between the local and remote oplogs.
 *       a. Keep track of what is rolled back to provide a summary to the user.
 *       b. Write rolled back documents to 'Rollback Files'.
 *   4. Increment the Rollback ID (RBID).
 *   5. Tell the storage engine to recover to the last stable timestamp.
 *   6. Write the oplog entry after the common point as the 'OplogTruncateAfterPoint'.
 *   7. Call recovery code.
 *       a. Truncate the oplog at the common point.
 *       b. Apply all oplog entries to the end of oplog.
 *   8. Trigger the on-rollback op observer.
 *   9. Transition to SECONDARY.
 *
 * If the node crashes while in rollback and the storage engine has not recovered to the last
 * stable timestamp yet, then rollback will simply restart against the new sync source upon restart.
 * If the node crashes after the storage engine has recovered to the last stable timestamp,
 * then the normal startup recovery code will run and finish the rollback process.
 *
 * If the sync source rolls back while we're searching for a common point, the connection should
 * get closed and finding the common point should fail.
